<h1>Image Transparency</h1>
<p>The opacity property is often used together with the :hover selector to change the opacity on mouse-over:</p>
<img src="picture.jpg" alt="Forest" width="300" height="300">

<p><b>Note:</b> In IE, a !DOCTYPE must be added for the :hover selector to work on other elements than the a element.</p>
